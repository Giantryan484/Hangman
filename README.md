# Hangman Project: Spanish 1

## Overview
In freshman year of high school (2021), we were assigned the task of creating a game that would help the other students in the class prepare for the Spanish I final exam. I decided to use this task as an opportunity to develop my then-rudimentary python skills by building a simple command-line game that let the user test their vocabulary knowledge. So, if anyone ever stumbles across this later in my career, keep in mind that this was litterally one of the first pieces of code I had ever written.
